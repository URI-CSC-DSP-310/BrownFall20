### Pandas, by Wes
- Pandas was designed to do data science on your laptop
- It's designed to be coupled tightly to numpy, which is why it's not very fast, especially with strings
- 


### Scikit Learn

- Data science for the many not the mighty
- Machine learning for all

```{code-cell} ipython3

```
