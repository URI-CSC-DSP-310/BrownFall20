    "a common convention in mathematical notation is to denote matrices (tables) by capitalized bold characters , vectors (lists) by lowercase bold characters and scalars (single values) by lowercase regular characters.\n",

    "- all of the features would be:  $\\mathbf{X}$\n",
    "- one variable for all samples or all variables for one sample would be $\\mathbf{x}$\n",

    "Starting from a dataset, we first make an additional designation about how we will use the different variables (columns). We will call most of them the _features_, which we denote mathematically with $\\mathbf{X}$ and we'll choose one to be the _target_ or _labels_, denoted by $\\mathbf{y}$.\n",

    "To do machine learning we start with __training data__ which we put as input to the __learning algorithm__. A learning algorithm might be a generic optimization procedure or a specialized procedure for a specific model. The learning algorithm outputs a trained __model__ or the parameters of the model. When we deploy a model we pair the __fit model__ with a __prediction algorithm__ or __decision__ algorithm to evaluate a new sample in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In experimenting and design, we need __testing data__ to evaluate how well our learning algorithm understood the world.  We need to use previously unseen data, because if we don't we can't tell if the prediction algorithm is using a rule that the learning algorithm produced or just looking up from a lookup table the result.  This can be thought of like the difference between memorization and understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the model does well on the training data, but not on test data, we say that it does not generalize well.  \n",
