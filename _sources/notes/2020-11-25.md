## Review

sklearn estimators have:
 fit, predict and score methods

split, train and test are the _steps_ we do, but not the names of methods of objects in `sklearn`


### matplotlib vs seaborn:
We've learned two plotting libraries. Why would you use seaborn over matplotlib?

- seaborn works better when the data is in a dataframe while matplotlib can work better with data in array form
- Matplotlib is more basic plotting, whereas seaborn has less syntax but more plotting customization and themes
- Seaborn uses simpler syntax  and easier to make complex intuitive plots with short commands
- seaborn is a higher level library that uses matplotlib "under the hood".  It's basically an easier way to graph, but directly using matplotlib can give us more freedom, but forces you to make all of the decisions.
- seaborn helps make "good" types of plots, both common and easy for people, on average, to read. Matplotlib, lets you do anything you want, even things that are likely to be confusing
- seaborn can show some statistical calculations while plotting
- seaborn makes categories easier to show, with for example the `hue`, `row`, and `column` parameters

## Vector representation review

Given this Vocabulary:

['and', 'are', 'cat', 'cats', 'dogs', 'pets', 'popular', 'videos']

represent: Cats and dogs are pets

Since we have the vocabulary, we can go word by word in the vocabulary and
[1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0]

build the vocabulary and transform with "Cats and dogs are pets"
[ 1,1,1,1,1]
