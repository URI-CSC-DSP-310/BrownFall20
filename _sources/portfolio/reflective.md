Annotate a whole session of class notes by submitting a PR to this repository. This applies after Dr. Brown's notes are uploaded, but not annotated. Use previously annotated notes as an example of what content should be added.
In your portfolio, include a 1 paragraph reflection on what you learned by contributing the annotation and a link to your pull request.

```{note}
It's okay if more than one person contributes annotations on the same day.  If there's a pull request there already, try to add different, additional insights but if it's not there when you start working and appears before you submit, that's ok.
