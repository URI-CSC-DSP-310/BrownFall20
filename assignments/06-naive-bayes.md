Remember, even if you aren't sure how to do every part of the assignment, submitting pseudocode, a list of your questions indicating where you got stuck, or a partial solution will get you personalized feedback. You might even earn level 1 achievements for the partial effort.

## For Classification Level 2:

[Submission template](https://classroom.github.com/a/fojgz8Cc)

1. Choose two datasets with continuous valued features and a categorical target value save them to the data folder. We recommend the [UCI Data Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
1. Load the data using the relative path.
1. Use exploratory data analysis to evaluate if Gaussian Naive Bayes is a good fit, based on its core assumptions
1. Confirm your predictions by fitting the classifier and evaluating its performance.


Use Markdown headings to introduce each dataset and description of the data, including its source, with a link. Include explanatory text at each step of your analysis.




_if you have dataset that you're  interested in that's got categorical or binary features only, you can try a different naive Bayes classifier. You still need to assess if the naive bayes assumption holds or not. Look into mutual information_

## For construct level 2

1. Make your own dataset for classification by merging unrelated data that you're interested in or querying a database


## Summarize and Viz level 2

Show some extra summary stats or plots
