# Assignment 6


__Due: 2020-10-20__


Remember, even if you aren't sure how to do every part of the assignment, submitting pseudocode, a list of your questions indicating where you got stuck, or a partial solution will get you personalized feedback. You might even earn level 1 achievements for the partial effort.

## For Classification Level 2:

[Submission template](https://classroom.github.com/a/fojgz8Cc)

You're going to train a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier five total times in this assignment in two notebooks.

1. Create one notebook where you load and answer the following for each of the four provided datasets with exploratory data analysis. Then fit and evaluate a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier.  
  - Does it meet the assumptions for Gaussian Naive Bayes?
  - If not which assumptions does it break?
  - Do you expect Gaussian Naive Bayes to work well on this dataset, why or why not?
1. Create a second notebook where you evaluated a dataset of your choice with continuous valued features and a categorical target value save them to the data folder. Include a description of the data, including its source, with a link. We recommend the [UCI Data Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
1. Load the data using the relative path.
1. Use exploratory data analysis to evaluate if Gaussian Naive Bayes is a good fit, based on its core assumptions
1. Confirm your predictions by fitting the classifier and evaluating its performance.


Include explanatory text at each step of your analysis.




_if you have dataset that you're  interested in that's got categorical or binary features only, you can try a different naive Bayes classifier. You still need to assess if the naive bayes assumption holds or not. Look into mutual information_

## For construct level 2

1. As your chosen dataset, build your own dataset for classification by merging two data  files  that you're interested in or querying a database.


## Summarize and Viz level 2

Show some extra summary stats or plots
