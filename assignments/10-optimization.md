# Assignment 10: Optimizing Models


__Due: 2020-11-17__

Choose a dataset with a modeling task that you are interested in. Choose a plausible model for the dataset and optimize the parameters of the model.

Explain and interpret your results. Keep your notebook focused (don't include things that don't advance the story or go on tangents) and complete (enough detail for someone to learn from your notebook and for us to know you understand)


Classification or regression will be easier to use for this assignment and next week's assignment. Next week, you'll continue with the same dataset and compare the model you optimized this week to another model.

This is an opportunity to earn any modeling (classification, regression, or clustering) skill, evaluation, and  optimize. If there are older skills that you would like evaluated at this point include a note in a markdown cell at the top of your notebook.
