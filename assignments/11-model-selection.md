# Assignment 11: Model Comparison

__Due: 2020-11-22__


Choose a dataset, it can be appropriate for classification, regression, or clustering. Fit at least two models for the same task and choose the appropriate metrics to compare the fit. Determine which model fits the data better and write a brief report. Summarize your findings with plots and tables as appropriate.

Explain and interpret your results. Keep your notebook focused (don't include things that don't advance the story or go on tangents) and complete (enough detail for someone to learn from your notebook and for us to know you understand).

This is an opportunity to earn any modeling (classification, regression, or clustering) skill, evaluation, and  optimize. If there are older skills that you would like evaluated at this point include a note in a markdown cell at the top of your notebook.
