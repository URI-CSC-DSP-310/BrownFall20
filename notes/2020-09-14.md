# Class 3: Welcome to Week 2

This week we will:
- clarify how this grading really works
- learn about accessing data
- use accessing data as motivation to review more python

## Grading and Assignment 1

- Solution function posted.
- note: not a sum
- read the rubric
- Brightspace will show grades as they're earned
- In class, respond on prismia
- Portfolio
  - will start posting prompts
   The docstring functions like a property of the function object. so it has to be inside.

## Iterables

Python has a general data type for objects that are designed to facilitate repetition of some sort, they're called `iterable`s

We've already seen one. Strings are `Iterable`s

```{code-cell} ipython3
name = 'sarah'
```

````{margin}
```{tip}
remember python indexes from 0
```
````
which means we can index them


```{code-cell} ipython3
name[3]
```
Indexing with a negative number counts from the end

```{code-cell} ipython3
name[-1]
```
Loops in python have similar syntax to the `if` and functions we saw last week:

```{code-cell} ipython3
for char in name:
    print(char*3)
```

some notes:
- `char` is called the loop variable
- `name` is called the collection- this can be any iterable type object in python
- `print(char*3)` is called the loop body
- python lets us use mathematical operations on strings

### Lists and List Comprehensions

We make a list with square brackets
```{code-cell} ipython3
names = ['sarah', 'Jose', 'Cam', 'Bri']
```

we can also build lists by folding a loop into the list construction

```{code-cell} ipython3
['hello' + n for n in names]
```

this is called a list comprehension

```{code-cell} ipython3
greetings = ['hello ' + n for n in names]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
greetings[0]
```

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries are a useful datatype in python. It is denoted by `{}` and contains `key: value` pairs separated by commas.

```{code-cell} ipython3
gh_names = {'brownsarahm':'Sarah Brown',
            'briannakathrynm1' : 'Brianna MacDonald',
            'jdion62':'Jacob Dion'}
gh_names
```
You can think of it like a list of the values with a named index.

```{code-cell} ipython3
gh_names['jdion62']
```

we can iterate over both the key and the value by using the `items` method on a dictionary. That makes another iterable object that can be used as a loop collection. It functions as a set of pairs now, so we get two loop variables:

```{code-cell} ipython3
for key, value in gh_names.items():
    print(value, "'s username is ", key)
```

If we iterate over the dictionary without that method, we get the keys.
```{code-cell} ipython3
for val in gh_names:
    print(val)
```

## Libraries

To use libraries in python we import them
````{margin}
```{tip}
note that `import` is a keyword and that in a Jupyter notebook, we can import anywhere and then the library can be used in any cell that is *run* after the import cell is *run*.  It's good practice to put them at the top and make your notebook runnable in sequence, but Jupyter won't force you to.
```
````
We will use [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) a lot in this class. It's the Python Data Analysis Library.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas
```

Once we import we can use the functions, datatypes, and values a library provides by using a `.` after the name. In a notebook, pressing tab will show you the options.

````{margin}
```{tip}
For example if you don't remember what kind of read functions there are in pandas, type `pandas.read` and then press tab to see options.
```
````

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["raises-exception"]
pandas.read_csv()
```

We can also use an alias to give a library a nickname to make it easier to use. `pd` is the standard alias for `pandas`

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
```

We can read in from a local path or a url. Let's read in the course map page of our course website.

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.read_html('https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall20/syllabus/course_map.html')
```

This makes a `list` of `pandas.DataFrame` objects. We can check that with the following

```{warning}
This cell was added after class, but the explanation was given in class
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(pd.read_html('https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall20/syllabus/course_map.html'))
```

To work with it though, we should save to a variable, then we can index into that list.

```{code-cell} ipython3
df_list = pd.read_html('https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall20/syllabus/course_map.html')
df_list[0]
```

When you display `DataFrames` in jupyter, they get nice formatting.
