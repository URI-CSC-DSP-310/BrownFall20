Assignment updated to [clarify continuous and categorical variables](https://github.com/rhodyprog4ds/BrownFall20/commit/f719a92c4d5dd00cbe8bf646d9d63280fb4b1e50)


## Loading Data

Importing the libraries for today. We'll continue plotting with pandas and we'll use  [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html) as well. Seaborn provides higher level plotting functions and [better formatting](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html).

````{margin}
The alias for `seaborn` is `sns` the result of an [inside joke](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues/229) among the developers in reference so [Samuel Norman Seaborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Seaborn) on The West Wing, per [stackexchange](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41499857/seaborn-why-import-as-sns)
````

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
```

loading the data as usual

```{code-cell} ipython3
data_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brownsarahm/python-socialsci-files/master/data/SAFI_full_shortname.csv'
```

We know that the `key_id` column should be used as an index, not as data, so we'll use the `index_col` parameter t do that from the beginning.
```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df = pd.read_csv(data_url,index_col='key_id')
safi_df.head()
```

We can make scatter plots as we saw Friday.
```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.plot.scatter('gps_Latitude','gps_Longitude')
```

With seaborn, however, we can control it more, changing the color of the points based on a column of the data.
```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.relplot(x= 'gps_Latitude',y='gps_Longitude',
           data=safi_df, hue='village')
```

We can also plot a single variable to see the quantiles (the box is 25%-50%) and see if there are outliers (the points outside the box).

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.boxplot('years_farm')
```

We can do some more conditiioning, even with only pandas. Using the `by` parameter will do a `groupby` operation first and then make the plot.

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.boxplot('years_farm', by='village')
```

We can also make the figure larger
```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.boxplot('years_farm', by='village',figsize=(12,8))
```


We can see how a single variable is distributed in more detail with the [seaborn displot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.displot.html#seaborn.displot).

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.displot(data=safi_df, x='years_farm',col='village')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.displot(data=safi_df, x='years_farm',col='village',kind='kde')
```

## Updating Seaborn
the `displot` is new in seaborn 0.11, on your terminal (mac, linux) or anaconda prompt(Windows):
```
pip install update seaborn
```

Then restart your notebook's kernel and re-run all cells

or, in a notebook, you can update with
```{margin}
This is set to not run on the served site
```

```
!pip install seaborn==0.11.0
```

## Regression plots

We can also plot with some calculations done for us already.

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.lmplot(x='years_farm',y='years_liv', data=safi_df,
           hue='village')
```

And we can make grids of plots with the `row` and `col` parameters. We can turn off the regression lines with the `fit_reg` parameter.

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.lmplot(x='years_farm',y='years_liv', data=safi_df,
           hue='village',  col='respondent_wall_type',row='respondent_floor_type',
           fit_reg=False)
```



```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.groupby('poultry')['members_count'].mean()
```

## Questions after class


## More practice

Test out the parameters of the plotting functions to see what they do.
