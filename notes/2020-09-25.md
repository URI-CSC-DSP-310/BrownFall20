## Announcements

1. closing notebooks

    - recall that they don't stop when you close the tabs
    - you need to stop it at the terminal it launched from
    - with: ctr + c as it says when you first [launch a notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#starting-the-notebook-server)

1. restart and rerun notebooks

    - notebooks are a continuous REPL as long as you have it open
    - if you change code, you could have, for example a variable that is no longer defined in the notebook as written, but that still exists in memory, so code that depends on it will still run, for now, but not after you restart next (eg if we run it while grading)
    - to check, [restart and rerun](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.html#Restarting-the-kernels) your notebook

1. say hello on zoom for attendance

## Setup

First we `import` packages and load data as normal.


```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

data_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brownsarahm/python-socialsci-files/master/data/SAFI_full_shortname.csv'
sns.set(font_scale=1.25)
```

I've added one new command here, Seaborn's []`set` function](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.set.html). It sets a bunch of theme aspects for plotting, here I used it to increase the font size.  


## Warmup Activity

How recreate this plot?

![image to copy](https://github.com/rhodyprog4ds/BrownFall20/blob/main/img/class8.png?raw=true)

First, load the data
```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df = pd.read_csv(data_url)
```

This is a [`displot`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.displot.html#seaborn.displot).  
```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.displot(data=safi_df, x='members_count',row='parents_liv',
            col = 'sp_parents_liv',hue='village',kind='kde')
```

This allows comparisons of how the village, respondent's parents living (`parents_liv`), and the spouse's (`sp_parents_liv`) influence the number of members of the household (`members_count`). The `kind='kde'` parameter uses the underlying [`kdeplot`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.kdeplot.html#seaborn.kdeplot) to apply [kernel density estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation)

````{margin}
```{tip}
This is a general strategy. Testing out parameters with different values is a valuable way to learn what they do, and to build intuition about what they do.  The documentation also has demos of a lot of values.
```
````

We can understand better what this does, by comparing what happens when we take it out.


```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.displot(data=safi_df, x='members_count',row='parents_liv',
            col = 'sp_parents_liv',hue='village')
```



## What about the rest of the columns?

We've used this SAFI dataset a lot, but we've only used a few of the many columns.  Let's look at all of them.

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.columns
```

We can look at the first few row to recall what sort of data are available in each column.

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.head()
```

It might be interesting to use the `items_owned` column to compare find out if there are differences between farms based on what items they have.

Maybe we'd want to see how many farms own each item, maybe we want to know how many farms own bicycle. Let's try `value_counts` out like we used before.

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df['items_owned'].value_counts()
```

The problem is this gives the count of each *list* of items instead of each item.  What we'd want instead is one column for each item, where the values in the column are 1 when the farm owns that item and 0 when they don't. This representation is sometimes called 1 hot encoding and other times (including in pandas) it's called dummy variables.

<!-- annotate: Using Dummy Variables -->
## Using Dummy Variables

Let's try this function out, first on the `village` column.

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.get_dummies(data= safi_df,columns=['village'])
```

Instead of scrolling, we can isolate the new columns we just created.

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df_villages = pd.get_dummies(data= safi_df,columns=['village'])
keep_cols = [col for col in safi_df_villages.columns if 'village_' in col]
safi_df_villages[keep_cols]
```
Note that now we have 3 columns, one for each village. This column was already usable, but it was well formatted an useful to illustrate what `get_dummies` does.

```{note}
try this out and compare the two, test out `get_dummies` on another column to be sure you know what it does.
```

Now, we can try it on `items_owned`.
_this time we'll filter the columns for display and inspection right away

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df_items = pd.get_dummies(data= safi_df,columns=['items_owned'])
keep_cols = [col for col in safi_df_items.columns if 'village_' in col]
safi_df_items[keep_cols]
```

This still isn't quite what we want, because each value in the `items_owned` column *looks* like a list but it's actually a string, we can check that with the `type` function.

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(safi_df['items_owned'][0])
```

<!-- annotate: Cleaning One Cell of Data -->
## Cleaning One Cell of Data

```{code-cell} ipython3
farm1_items = safi_df['items_owned'][0]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
farm1_items
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(farm1_items)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
list(farm1_items)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
farm1_items
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
farm1_items.split(';')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
farm1_items.replace('[','').replace(']','').replace("'","").split(';')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
[i.strip() for i in  farm1_items.replace('[','').replace(']','').replace("'","").split(';')]
```

## Applying this to the rest of the data

```{code-cell} ipython3
def separate_items(row):
    '''
    '''
    if type(row['items_owned'])==str:
        return [i.strip() for i in  row['items_owned'].replace('[','').replace(']','').replace("'","").split(';')]
    else:
        return []

```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df['items_owned_clean'] = safi_df.apply(separate_items,axis=1)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.head()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```
