 # Class 10: Cleaning review and Ray Summit Keynotes

+++

- Say hello on zoom chat
- join prismia
- sign up so you can watch Ray Summit talks by Pandas and Scikit learn

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# %load http://drsmb.co/310
data_url = 'https://github.com/rhodyprog4ds/inclass-data/raw/main/ca_dds_summary.xlsx'
```

Let's look at the data
```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.read_excel(data_url)
```

We can read multiple rows in as the header
```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.read_excel(data_url,header=list(range(4)))
```

Looks good, let's save this to a DataFrame

```{code-cell} ipython3
ca_dds_df = pd.read_excel(data_url,header=list(range(4)))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
ca_dds_df.head()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
ca_dds_df.columns
```


## Ray Summit Notes

__contribute things you learned here__


### Pandas, by Wes
- Pandas was designed to do data science on your laptop
- It's designed to be coupled tightly to numpy, which is why it's not very fast, especially with strings
-


### Scikit Learn

- Data science for the many not the mighty
- Machine learning for all
