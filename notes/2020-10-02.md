# Class 11: Cleaning Data

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# %load http://drsmb.co/310
data_url = 'https://github.com/rhodyprog4ds/inclass-data/raw/main/ca_dds_summary.xlsx'
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
ca_dds_df = pd.read_excel(data_url, header=list(range(3)))
ca_dds_df
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(ca_dds_df)
```
we can do df.index to look at what the index is in our dataframe
```{code-cell} ipython3
ca_dds_df.index
```
columns are tuple values. We can index to the first column as below. As we can see by running this code, this column has three names initially. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
ca_dds_df.columns[0]
```
By the following code we can assign the first column as the index of original dataframe. If we assign "False" to the "inplace", it will make the changes in a new dataframe.
```{code-cell} ipython3
ca_dds_df.set_index(ca_dds_df.columns[0],inplace=True)
```
The updated dataframe looks like below. We still have the name of index inappropriate and aslo there are empty rows. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
ca_dds_df
```
we can drop rows with "all" or "any"  NaN values. We would choose "all", since if we choose "all" we will loose many rows here and we do not want it.
```{code-cell} ipython3
ca_dds_df.dropna(how='all',inplace=True)
```
We can view the index by the following code. Remember that this is not a regular column anymore since we assigned it to be our dataframe index.
```{code-cell} ipython3
ca_dds_df.index
```
Now lets rename the index to a more meaningful name as below.
```{code-cell} ipython3
ca_dds_df.index.rename('Age Cohort',inplace=True)
```
But we still have multi-row headers which should be corrected. We also want to have columns for "Age", "Race", "Gender", "Mean" and "Count".


Let's flip the dataframe and unstack the index. For this purpose, we should unstack it in two levels of "Race" and "Gender".  After unstacking we want to flip it again and finally reset the index.
```{code-cell} ipython3
ca_dds_df.T.unstack(level= [0,1]).T.reset_index()
```
All these changes will be save into a new dataframe named "ca_dds_clean".
```{code-cell} ipython3
ca_dds_clean = ca_dds_df.T.unstack(level= [0,1]).T.reset_index()
ca_dds_clean.head()
```
Now let's change name of columns to appropriate names. 
As we can see here, we can not change elements of an index. Instead we should rerassign the whole column names.
The reason is that index variable's type is index not a list, tuple or a regular python based datatype. Index has special properties and python does not allow mutaple operations or assigning values to that. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
ca_dds_clean.columns[1] = 'Race'
```
Column names are as below before chaning them.
```{code-cell} ipython3
type(ca_dds_clean.columns)
```
The way we can rename index by using ".rename()" function and assigning a dictionary of old and new names to the column argument of this fuction.
```{code-cell} ipython3
ca_dds_clean.rename(columns= {'level_1':'Race', 'level_2':'Gender'},inplace=True)
ca_dds_clean.head()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
ca_dds_clean['count'][0]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
ca_dds_clean.Gender[0]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
ca_dds_clean.Gender[0].lower()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
clean_cols = {c:c.lower().replace(' ','_') for c in ca_dds_clean.columns}
ca_dds_clean.rename(columns=clean_cols,inplace=True)
ca_dds_clean.head()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
ca_dds_clean.fillna('*')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```
