# Class 12: Constructing Datasets from Multiple Sources

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
```



Download data from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/rhodyprog4ds/inclass-data) by clicking on the green code button and choosing .zip. Then unzip the data and save it in a data folder in the same folder as the notebook.

```{code-cell} ipython3
games_df18 = pd.read_csv('data/2018-games.csv')
games_df19 = pd.read_csv('data/2019-games.csv')
```

<!-- annotate: Stacking DataFrames -->
## Stacking DataFrames

```{code-cell} ipython3
games_df18.head(2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
games_df19.head(2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
games_df18.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
games_df19.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
games_df = pd.concat([games_df18,games_df19])
games_df.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
games_df.columns
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
games_df.drop(columns= 'Unnamed: 0',inplace=True,)
games_df.head(2)
```

## Merging Data Frames

```{code-cell} ipython3
teams_df = pd.read_csv('data/teams.csv')
teams_df.head(2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
merge1_df = pd.merge(teams_df,games_df,left_on='TEAM_ID', right_on = 'HOME_TEAM_ID')
merge1_df.head(2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
merge1_df.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
merge2_df = pd.merge(teams_df, games_df,left_on='TEAM_ID', right_on = 'HOME_TEAM_ID', how='outer')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
merge2_df.head(2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
merge2_df.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
merge1_df.groupby('ARENA').mean()
```

## How to combine the same data for different outcomes

```{code-cell} ipython3
players18 = pd.read_csv('data/2018-players.csv')
players19 = pd.read_csv('data/2019-players.csv')
players18.head()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
players18.shape, players19.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.concat([players18,players19]).shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.merge(players18,players19,)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.merge(players18,players19,on='PLAYER_ID', how='inner')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.merge(players18,players19,on='PLAYER_ID', how='outer')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.merge(players18,players19,on='PLAYER_ID', how='left')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```
## Try it yourself

Try different merges and inspect them:
- how many rows & columns?
- Where are NaN values inserted?
- What rows from the original datasets are not included?
- describe each type of merge in your own words


Split a DataFrame into separate data frames by subsetting the columns and indexing the rows with `loc`, then use concat to put it back together. Programmatically check that it's back together correctly.
