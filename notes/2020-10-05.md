# Class 12: Constructing Datasets from Multiple Sources

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
```

To use relative paths as in class (`data/2018-games.csv`) instead of a full url `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/inclass-data/main/2018-games.csv`, download data from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/rhodyprog4ds/inclass-data) by clicking on the green code button and choosing .zip. Then unzip the data and save it in a data folder in the same folder as the notebook. For the class notes, the urls make it so that the notebook can run without having to store the data in another place. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
games_df18 = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/inclass-data/main/2018-games.csv')
games_df19 = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/inclass-data/main/2019-games.csv')
```

## Stacking DataFrames

```{code-cell} ipython3
games_df18.head(2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
games_df19.head(2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
games_df18.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
games_df19.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
games_df = pd.concat([games_df18,games_df19])
games_df.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
games_df.columns
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
games_df.drop(columns= 'Unnamed: 0',inplace=True,)
games_df.head(2)
```

## Merging Data Frames

```{code-cell} ipython3
teams_df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/inclass-data/main/teams.csv')
teams_df.head(2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
merge1_df = pd.merge(teams_df,games_df,left_on='TEAM_ID', right_on = 'HOME_TEAM_ID')
merge1_df.head(2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
merge1_df.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
merge2_df = pd.merge(teams_df, games_df,left_on='TEAM_ID', right_on = 'HOME_TEAM_ID', how='outer')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
merge2_df.head(2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
merge2_df.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
merge1_df.groupby('ARENA').mean()
```

## How to combine the same data for different outcomes

```{code-cell} ipython3
players18 = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/inclass-data/main/2018-players.csv')
players19 = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/inclass-data/main/2019-players.csv')
players18.head()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
players18.shape, players19.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.concat([players18,players19]).shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.merge(players18,players19,)
```

Using `how='inner'` gives us only the `'PLAYER_ID'` that are in both DataFrames
```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.merge(players18,players19,on='PLAYER_ID', how='inner')
```

Using `outer` gives us the `'PLAYER_ID'` that are in one or both of the DataFrame
```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.merge(players18,players19,on='PLAYER_ID', how='outer')
```

Using  `left` gives us the `'PLAYER_ID'` that are in the left(`players18`) DataFrame, including those that are in both DataFrame
`right` would give players in the `players19` DataFrame or both DataFrames
```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.merge(players18,players19,on='PLAYER_ID', how='left')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```
## Try it yourself

Try different merges and inspect them:
- how many rows & columns?
- Where are NaN values inserted?
- What rows from the original datasets are not included?
- describe each type of merge in your own words


Split a DataFrame into separate data frames by subsetting the columns and indexing the rows with `loc`, then use concat to put it back together. Programmatically check that it's back together correctly.
