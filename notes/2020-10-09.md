# Class 14: More on Databases

Today, we'll do some more work with databases to clarify how they work.

As before we `import` libraries
```{code-cell} ipython3
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
```

Next we establish a connection to the datbase

```{code-cell} ipython3
con = sqlite3.connect('data/SQL_SAFI.sqlite')
```

Then we place a cursor
```{code-cell} ipython3
cur = con.cursor()
```

Next we can run a query, without pulling the results back to Python, just letting them sit ready in the database.

```{code-cell} ipython3
cur.execute('SELECT * FROM Farms')
```

To see the description of the cursor, we have to run the query first, so we can see this now we can look at only the header information from the query, which we could then use to make more specific queries instead.

There's a `decription` attribute on a cursor once it's run a query.
```{code-cell} ipython3
colnames = []
for desc in cur.description:
    colnames.append(desc)

colnames
```

This has a lot that we don't actually need, so we can make that neater.

```{code-cell} ipython3
colnames = []
for desc in cur.description:
    colnames.append(desc[0])
```

We can now get the data
```{code-cell} ipython3
data = cur.fetchall()
```

and view the first two rows
```{code-cell} ipython3
data[:2]
```

then we can use it as regular data in python, to for example make a DataFrame
```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.DataFrame(data =data, columns = colnames)
```


We should always close the connection when we're done with it.
```{code-cell} ipython3
con.close()
```

Another way to work with a database is the safe open using the [`with` statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with)
```{code-cell} ipython3
with sqlite3.connect('data/SQL_SAFI.sqlite') as con:
    cur = con.cursor()
    cur.execute('SELECT * FROM farms')
    row = cur.fetchone()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
row
```

## Query Refresh

```{code-cell} ipython3
con = sqlite3.connect('data/SQL_SAFI.sqlite')
```

How could we query to select only the data from the village (`A09_village`) God?

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags:[hide-input]
df = pd.read_sql_query('SELECT * FROM farms WHERE A09_village = "God"',con)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
df
```

We can confirm the results
```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.unique(df['A09_village'])
```

##  Try it yourself

Try writing different queries on a new database.  There is a link to a source of databases in the [data page under resources](resources/datasets)
